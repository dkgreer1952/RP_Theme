# RP_Theme

## Basic template Razor Pages application illustrating how to implement a light/dark/system selector menu for Bootstrap 5.3.0 and above.

### If Light or Dark is selected, that is stored in the browser's local storage (per machine) and overrides the Windows Light or Dark mode setting.
### If System is selected, no setting is stored.  Instead, the application theme will default to the Windows mode setting.
### If the browser is open on the application and the Windows mode is changed, the application will be notified and will change its theme accordingly.
